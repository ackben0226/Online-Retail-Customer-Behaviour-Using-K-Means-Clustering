## 🔍 Technical Implementation
📊 Data Pipeline Architecture
- e

## 🔧 Core Components
### 1. Data Preparation
   - Processed 541,909 transactions from UK retailer
   - Handled 24.9% missing CustomerIDs
   - Detected & treated outliers using IQR ranges
     
### 2. RFM Feature Engineering

```python
def calculate_rfm(data):
    snapshot_date = data['InvoiceDate'].max() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    rfm = data.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
        'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (snapshot_date - x.max()).days,  # Recency
        'InvoiceNo': 'nunique',                                    # Frequency
        'TotalAmount': 'sum'                                       # Monetary
    })
```

### 3. Machine Learning Workflow
   - Optimal K=4 clusters (Silhouette Score: 0.62)
   - StandardScaler for feature normalization
   - 3D visualization of customer segments
