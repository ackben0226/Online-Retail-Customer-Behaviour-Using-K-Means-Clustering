## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
To cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering, enabling better targeting and business strategy.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed nulls, duplicates, and returns.
   - Filtered transactions with valid CustomerID.

2. **RFM Feature Engineering**
   - Recency: Days since last purchase.
   - Frequency: Number of purchases.
   - Monetary: Total amount spent.

3. **Data Scaling**
   - Standardized RFM features for clustering.

4. **Optimal K Selection**
   - Elbow Method & Silhouette Score:

5. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Clustered customers into 4 segments.
   - Interpreted and visualized the results.
